    Draws a circle using a 360 degree arc. This is not a perfect arc/circle because it is
    approximated using many small lines. The circle is technically a polygon with a really
    high side count.

    draw_circle takes one argument of the int/float data type, the radius of the circle, which
    is passed to the function parameter 'radius'. The function body calls another function,
    draw_arc, which takes draw_circle's radius parameter and the integer 360, which is the angle the arc.
